      <p class="text">During his life, Van Gogh painted about 2,100 artworks in just over a decade, including around 860 oil paintings. They include still lifes, landscapes, portraits of other people and self-portraits as well. His art is distinguished by bold colors and expressive and dramatic brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. 
         <br>
         <br>They were mostly made in mania period,of course, Vincent had a bipolar affective disorder,<strong><i> ICD-10-CM Code for Bipolar disorder F31 </i></strong>,as it known. 
         <br>
         <br>All of his neighbours noticed Vincent's <strong>strange behavior</strong> and even know him as a madman: he woke up before the sunrise and went to paint landscapes. He worked late, even without any lunch or a glass of water when it was summer. And...despite his unrelenting talent, he was not commercially successful during his time. He couldn't afford himself properly.
         Without any glory,Van Gogh had a short and turbulent life and suffered from delusions and psychotic episodes. Though he worried about his mental stability, he often disregarded his physical health, drank heavily, and did not eat regularly. During one of his seizures, he cut off his left earlobe which he later offered to a woman at a local brothel.
      </p>
      <p class="text">Besides <strong>mania</strong>, he also had <strong>depressive episodes</strong>,of course. His depression and mania episodes were getting stonger due to the lack of proper treatment and an established daily routine, and on 27th of July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest. His attending doctor and neighbour, a Frenchman named Paul-Ferdinand Gachet, refused to help him due to serious damage of Vincent's chest. Vincent died from his injuries two days after. 
         <br>
         <br><strong> His last words are considered to be:"The sadness will last forever".</strong> 
         <br>
         <br>Vincent seemed to be active, cheerful and even happy man before he comitted suicide. He inform his brother Theo about intention to commit suicide in none of his letters: Theo was schoked by his sudden death. This is how F31 feels. 
         <br>Though he was unsuccessful during his lifetime and was considered a madman and a failure by most people, Van Gogh is now deemed as one of the most talented artists of all time. Not only that, his works are among the world‚Äôs most valuable and prized paintings to have ever sold at auction.
