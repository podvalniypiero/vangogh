      <p class="text">I love Vincent with all my heart, I adore him. He has been my personal kind of inspiration for many years. Vincent is an extremely strong man and a great talent. I'm incredibly sorry that Vincent had been bullied throughout his life. In addition, he was terribly poor and lonely, suffering from bipolar disorder - alternating episodes of mania and depression.

         <p class="text quo"><br>Moreover, Vincent sold himself only one piece in his entire life - Red Vineyards in Arles. <br>He was not recognized as a genius being alive.
            <br> <br>He died in poverty and terrible loneliness. Vincent had only one soulmate - his brother Theo, to whom he constantly wrote.
