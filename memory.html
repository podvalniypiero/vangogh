      <p class="text">In the final two years of his life, Vincent had gained recognition amongst the avant-garde and his work had been displayed in exhibitions in Paris and Brussels. 
         <br>After Vincent's death, his brother Theo wanted nothing more than to raise the profile of his brother's work.
         <br> But just six months later, Theo also passed away.
         <br>
         <br>His widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, set about completing the task. She sold some of Vincent’s works, loaned others out for exhibitions and – also very importantly – published his letters to Theo.

      <p class="text quo">"What am I in the eyes of most people – a nonentity or an eccentric or an obnoxious person – someone who has no position in society and never will have, in short the lowest of the low. 
         <br>Well, then – even if that were all absolutely true, I should one day like to show by my work what there is in the heart of such an eccentric, of such a nobody." - Vincent Van Gogh

            <p class="text" >Every year or two the entire collection of Van Gogh descendants come together and complete a trip to the places Vincent lived and worked around Europe, in an effort to impress upon the younger generations the importance of the legacy.
               More than 120 years after Vincent Van Gogh's death, we're still discovering new things about his paintings and who they depict.
               And then there is the foundation board work and tending to the museum in Amsterdam.

               <br>
               "We have a whole program for the next generation," - says Vincent's distant relatives, who took their own part in the world glorification.
